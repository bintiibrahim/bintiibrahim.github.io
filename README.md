LDATest is a dummy repository to test out different archiving stratgies.

# Revised archiving strategy for online version

1.	ewfrees makes a PR for all finalized changes into OpenActTexts/LossDataAnalytics#master
2.	OpenActTexts creates a release v1.0
3.	OpenActTexts creates a branch OpenActTexts/ LossDataAnalytics#v1.0
4.	When v2.0 is available, the process repeats

# For offline version

1. Maintained on ewfrees/LossDataAnalytics/DownloadOffline.html
